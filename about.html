                        <p> Whatâ€™s in a song? That which we call a tune would by any other ear sound just as sweet...</p>
                        <p> This collection of songs from my friends and family aims to explore the connection between people and music; music and memory; memories and the way they makes us feel. </p>
                        <p> For each entry, I asked "what is a song you find meaningful?" and recorded the answer, which was then transcribed by hand. Rather than collect scripted and polished gradebook responses, I hoped that I could capture the authenticity of the person's natural cadence. </p>
                        <p>There's a bit of irony in summarizing each song by the core emotion(s) that shone through in the interviewee's description because, well, those feelings are based entirely on personal experience. Your listening experience might deviate slightly, or bear no resemblance to theirs at all. And I guess that's what this is really all about. </p>
